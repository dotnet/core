You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your

Reports via MSRC may qualify for the .NET Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Bug Bounty including terms and conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.
