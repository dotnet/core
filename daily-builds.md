# .NET Core Daily Builds -- Preview Releases

The .NET Core team builds several branches of the product daily. You can install these builds to try out pre-released functionality. The branches are typically either for preview or [servicing versions](daily-builds-servicing.md) of the product.

Preview branches are for new major/minor versions of .NET Core that have not yet been released and are not yet supported.
