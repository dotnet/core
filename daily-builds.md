# .NET Daily Builds -- Servicing and future releases

The .NET team builds many branches of the product daily. You can install these builds to try out functionality prior to release.

Daily builds, for both future and servicing branches, are available as Docker container images from the [Microsoft Container Registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-nightly/).
