# dotnetsay .NET Core Global Tools Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use and create .NET Core Global Tools. It works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

You must have [.NET Core 2.1 Preview 1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/02/27/announcing-net-core-2-1-preview-1/) or higher installed.

## Try the pre-built `dotnetsay` Global Tool

You can quickly try the `dotnetsay` global tool using the following commands:

```console
dotnet install tool -g dotnetsay
dotnetsay
```

This command will install [dotnetsay from nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/).

> Note: You may need to open a new command/terminal window the first time you install a tool.

## Getting the sample

The easiest way to get the sample is by cloning the samples repository with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), using the following instructions.

```console
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/core/
```

You can also [download the repository as a zip](https://github.com/dotnet/core/archive/master.zip).

## Build the Tool

You can build and package the tool using the following commands. The instructions assume that you are in the root of the repository.

```console
cd samples
cd dotnetsay
dotnet pack -c release -o nupkg
```

The last command packs the tool as a NuGet package in the `nupkg` directory. You can host the package at [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/) or any other NuGet feed. The tool is ready to install and test.

The `PackAsTool` property in the project file makes it a global tool, as you can see in the following example. That's all you need to add to a console app to make it a tool.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
    <PackAsTool>true</PackAsTool>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Install the Tool

You can install the tool using the following command.

```console
dotnet install tool -g dotnetsay
```

For Preview 1, defining the source during installation doesn't work correctly, so you need a nuget.config file to test your new tool without deploying it to a NuGet feed. You can do this by placing this nuget.config in your project directory that looking similar to the followin example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
 <packageSources>
    <clear/>
    <add key="local-packages" value="./nupkg" />
 </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

## Run the Tool

You can run the tool using the following command.

```console
dotnetsay
```

## Uninstall the Tool

At present, there is no formal uninstall capability. We'll add that in Preview 2. Instead you need to delete the tool from one of following locations (as appropriate to your operating system):

On Windows:
 * `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools`

On Linux and OSX:
 * `~/.dotnet/tools`
