# .NET Core Samples

This directory contains samples that you can use to test out [.NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io). They are small and simple, and are used to get your feet wet with .NET Core as fast as possible. 

## A note about project formats

Newer .NET Core projects use a newly improved `.csproj` based file format as opposed to the original `project.json` format used in older .NET Core projects. For samples that work with older builds of the .NET Core tooling see the projects under [json-based](json-based/Readme.ms). For samples that use the new .csproj format see the samples under [csproj-based](csproj).
