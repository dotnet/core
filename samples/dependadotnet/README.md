# Dependadotnet -- Generator for Dependabot config.yml for .NET

[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) is a GitHub service for automatically updating dependencies listed in project files for various package managers, including NuGet.

Dependabot works out of the box if you have a solution (`.sln`) or project file (like `.csproj`) at the root or other (singular) location. It also supports `packages.config`.

This tool is for repos that contain projects that are [not discoverable from any one location](https://github.com/dependabot/feedback/issues/632). [dotnet/samples](https://github.com/dotnet/samples) is a good example of this case, and has a [dependabot.yml](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/.github/dependabot.yml) (generated by this tool) that describes all projects within the repo.

## Install the tool

Use the following instructions to install [dependadotnet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dependadotnet/)

```console
dotnet tool install -g dependadotnet
dependadotnet [repo-root]
```

You can uninstall the tool using the following command.

```console
dotnet tool uninstall -g dependadotnet
```

## Usage

`dependadotnet [path-to-repo-root]`

Alternatively, if you are in the repo root, you can use the following pattern to avoid needing to write the path:

`dependadotnet .`

The tool writes to stdout. The following pattern is recommended to generate the dependabot config file (assuming the `.github` directory exists):

`dependadotnet . > .github\dependabot.yml`
