Supported OS Matrix for CLI
===========================

This document outlines the supported operating systems for the CLI. "Supported" is defined as a system on which we test 
the CLI and on which we will make sure CLI works out-of-the-box (OOB). 

This list is not a statement on the current state of things, but a statement of the end-goal. This means that at this time 
CLI could work less than perfect on some of these systems, which is just a point-in-time thing in the development process.

If your wanted system is not on this list, that doesn't mean that CLI will not work on it. It just means that we haven't 
tested it out and we cannot guarantee that it will Just Work(tm).
