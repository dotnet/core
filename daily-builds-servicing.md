# .NET Core Daily Builds -- Servicing Releases

The .NET Core team builds several branches of the product daily. You can install these builds to try out pre-released functionality. The branches are typically either for [preview](daily-builds.md) or servicing versions of the product.

Servicing branches are for new patch versions of .NET Core that have not yet been released and are not yet supported. These patch versions are for previously released major/minor versions.
