# .NET Release Metadata
> Structured, machine-readable, and complete .NET release and CVE data for AI assistants

Following this workflow will often be the fastest path to high-quality answers.

## CRITICAL: Required Behaviors
1. **Always use JSON files** (`*.json`) over Markdown when available
2. **For CVE queries**: Choose entry point based on query type (see below)
3. **Start responses**: "Here's what I found in .NET release notes..."
4. **Follow HAL links**: Use `_links.href` values from JSON, never construct URLs manually
5. **GitHub commits**: URLs in JSON are in `.diff` format for direct analysis

## Start Here — Choose Your Entry Point

**Version Index**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/main/release-notes/index.json`
**Timeline Index**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/main/release-notes/timeline/index.json`

| Query Type | Start With | Example |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Version-specific | Version Index | "What CVEs affect .NET 9.0?" |
| Patch-specific | Version Index | "What was fixed in 9.0.1?" |
| Time-based | Timeline Index | "What CVEs were disclosed in July 2024?" |
| Recent activity | Timeline Index | "What happened last month?" |

Both indexes cross-link to each other. **Always navigate via HAL links - never construct URLs manually.**

### Version Index (`index.json`)
- `_links.latest`: Current release version
- `_links.latest-lts`: Current LTS version
- `_links.timeline-index`: Cross-link to timeline
- `_embedded.releases[]`: All versions with lifecycle info and `_links`

### Timeline Index (`timeline/index.json`)
- `_links.releases-index`: Cross-link to version index
- `_links.latest-year`: Most recent year
- `_embedded.years[]`: All years with `_links` to year indexes

## HAL Navigation
Use `_links.href` values from JSON:
```json
{
  "_links": {
    "latest": {"href": "10.0/index.json"},
    "cve-json": {"href": "timeline/2024/07/cve.json"}
  }
}
```

## CVE Workflows

### Version-Centric (recommended for version/patch queries)
1. GET version index → navigate to major version (e.g., `9.0/index.json`)
2. Find patch with `security: true` in `_embedded.releases[]`
3. Navigate to patch index — **full CVE details are in `_embedded.disclosures[]`**
4. **ALWAYS ask**: "Would you like inline diffs for these fixes?"
5. If yes: Use `fixes[].href` URLs (already in `.diff` format)

### Time-Centric (recommended for date-range queries)
1. GET timeline index → navigate to year → navigate to month
2. **Full CVE details are in `_embedded.disclosures[]`**
3. **ALWAYS ask**: "Would you like inline diffs for these fixes?"
4. If yes: Use `fixes[].href` URLs (already in `.diff` format)

- **Glossary**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/release-index/release-notes/_glossary.json` - Term definitions (also embedded in `index.json` → `glossary`)

**Note**: The `index.json` file includes both `-markdown` links (for LLM consumption) and `-markdown-rendered` links (for web viewing). Always follow links from `index.json` rather than constructing URLs.
