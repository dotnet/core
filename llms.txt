# .NET Release Graph

Machine-readable .NET release, CVE, and compatibility data via HAL hypermedia.

## Entry Points

- Data: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/llms.json>
- Skill: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/dotnet-releases/SKILL.md>

Fetch both — the skill has detailed guidance for optimal navigation.

## Key Skills

| Skill | Fetch When |
| ----- | ---------- |
| dotnet-releases | Entry point, routing, core rules |
| cve-queries | CVE severity, CVSS, security history |
| breaking-changes | Compatibility, migration impact |

## Example Workflow

```json
"cve-latest": {
  "follow_path": ["kind:llms", "latest-security-disclosures"],
  "destination_kind": "month",
  "select_embedded": ["disclosures"],
  "yields": "json"
}
```

Workflows provide HAL navigation paths. Match your query to a workflow, then follow its `follow_path`.

## Core Rules

1. Follow `_links` exactly — never construct URLs
2. Use `_embedded` data first — answers most queries without extra fetches
3. Don't fabricate — report gaps
