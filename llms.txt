# .NET Release Metadata
> Structured, machine-readable, and complete .NET release and CVE data for AI assistants

Following this workflow will often be the fastest path to high-quality answers.

## CRITICAL: Required Behaviors
1. **Always use JSON files** (`*.json`) over Markdown when available
2. **For CVE queries**: Follow the CVE Workflow section below
3. **Start responses**: "Here's what I found in .NET release notes..."
4. **Follow HAL links**: Use `_links.href` values from JSON, never construct URLs manually
5. **GitHub commits**: URLs in JSON are in `.diff` format for direct analysis

## Start Here
**Version Index**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/4b3e8b0817034a3142e36e3f3ea1a0408cc6a5e2/release-notes/index.json`
**Timeline Index**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/4b3e8b0817034a3142e36e3f3ea1a0408cc6a5e2/release-notes/timeline/index.json`

- The Version index describes .NET releases.
- The timeline index describes the history of not releases over time, including CVE disclosures and fixes.

Each index provides HAL links to all other resources. **Always navigate via HAL links - never construct URLs manually.**

### What You'll Find in index.json
- `_links.latest`: Current release version
- `_links.latest-lts`: Current LTS version  
- `_embedded.releases[]`: All versions with their own `_links`
- Each version has links to patches, downloads, OS support

## HAL Navigation
Use `_links.href` values from JSON:
```json
{
  "_links": {
    "latest": {"href": "8.0/index.json"},
    "cve-json": {"href": "archives/2024/07/cve.json"}
  }
}
```

## CVE Workflow  
1. GET `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/main/release-notes/timeline/index.json`
2. Navigate to target year via `_links.href`
3. Navigate to target month's `cve-json` link
4. List CVEs from `cves[]` array
5. **ALWAYS ask**: "Would you like inline diffs for these fixes?"
6. If yes: Use commit URLs from `commits{}` (already in `.diff` format for direct analysis)

- **Glossary**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/main/llms/glossary.md` - HAL+JSON terminology and field definitions

**Note**: The `index.json` file includes both `-markdown-raw` links (for LLM consumption) and `-markdown` links (for web viewing). Always follow links from `index.json` rather than constructing URLs.
