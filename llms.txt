# .NET Release Graph — Quick Reference

Machine-readable .NET release, CVE, and compatibility data for AI assistants.

## Rules

1. Follow `_links["..."].href` exactly — never construct URLs
2. Start with llms.json — it answers most queries directly
3. If data is missing, don't infer or fabricate
4. Prefer graph data over internet searches
5. Never guess version availability, release timing, or CVE presence

## Entry Point

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/release-index/release-notes/llms.json

This is the only URL you should call directly. All other URLs must be discovered via `_links["..."].href`.

## Query Patterns

| Query | Data Location | Fetches |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Latest patch for .NET X | `_embedded.latest_patches[]` filter by `release` | 1 |
| Is .NET X supported? EOL date? | `_embedded.latest_patches[]` → `supported`, `eol_date` | 1 |
| What versions are supported? | `_embedded.latest_patches[]` → all have `supported: true` | 1 |
| CVEs in latest security patch | `_embedded.latest_security_month[]` → `cve_count`, `cve_records` | 1 |
| CVEs since [date] | `latest-security-month` link → walk `prev-security` | 1 + N |
| Critical CVE this month? | `latest-security-month` link → `_embedded.disclosures[]` | 2 |
| Breaking changes for .NET X | `latest_patches[].release-major` → `compatibility-json` | 2 |
| TFMs for .NET X | `latest_patches[].release-major` → `target-frameworks-json` | 2 |
| SDK feature bands for .NET X | `latest_patches[].latest-sdk` | 2 |
| Download latest SDK | `latest_patches[].latest-sdk` → `_embedded.bands[]` | 2 |
| Is my distro supported? | `latest_patches[].release-major` → `supported-os-json` | 2-3 |
| EOL version info (e.g., .NET 6) | `releases-index` → version → `latest-security` or timeline | 3-5 |

**Note:** `llms.json` only contains supported versions. For EOL versions, use `releases-index` link to find the version, then follow `latest-security` to the last security patch.

## Navigation Shortcuts in llms.json

Each `_embedded.latest_patches[]` object includes:
- `self` — link to patch index
- `latest-security` — link to latest security patch for that version
- `release-major` — link to major version index (for TFMs, breaking changes, supported OS)
- `latest-sdk` — link to SDK index (for feature bands, downloads)

These shortcuts let you reach version-specific resources in 2 fetches instead of 3.

## CVE Queries

**For current security status:** `_embedded.latest_security_month[]` has `cve_count` and `cve_records[]` per version.

**For CVE history:** Follow `latest-security-month` link, then walk `prev-security` links. Each month index has `_embedded.disclosures[]` with:
- `id`, `title`, `cvss_score`, `cvss_severity`
- `affected_releases`, `affected_products`
- `fixes[]` with commit diff URLs

**For deep CVE analysis:** Follow `cve-json` link from month index for CVSS vectors, CWE, package version ranges.

The `prev-security` links skip non-security months and cross year boundaries automatically.

## Expected Fetch Counts

| Query Type | Fetches |
|------------|---------|
| Embedded data (patch versions, support status, CVE counts) | 1 |
| Version-specific resources (SDK, TFM, breaking changes) | 2 |
| CVE history over N security months | 1 + N |
| Deep CVE analysis (CVSS vectors, CWE) | 2-3 |

If your count significantly exceeds these, you may be navigating inefficiently.

## Graph Structure

- Properties use `snake_case`; link relations use `kebab-case`
- `_embedded` contains pre-fetched data; `_links` contains navigation
- `latest` and `latest_lts` reference supported (not preview) releases
- Discover available links on any resource: `jq '._links | keys[]'`
