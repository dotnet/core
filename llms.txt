# .NET Release Graph

Machine-readable .NET release, CVE, and compatibility data via HAL hypermedia.

## Entry Point

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/llms.json

## Core Rules

1. **Follow `_links["..."].href` exactly** — never construct graph URLs. External URLs (e.g., GitHub diffs in `fixes[]`) can be used directly.
2. **Use `_embedded` data first** — it answers most queries without extra fetches
3. **If data is missing, don't fabricate** — report the gap

## What's in llms.json

| Property | Contains |
|----------|----------|
| `_embedded.latest_patches[]` | Latest patch per supported version with EOL dates, support status, CVE counts |
| `_links` | Navigation to version indexes, timeline, security months |

## Skills

Fetch these when your query matches. **Core Rules above apply to all skills.**

### Task-Specific Skills

| Skill | Fetch When | URL |
|-------|------------|-----|
| cve.md | CVE queries needing severity, CVSS, or history | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/cve.md |
| breaking-changes.md | Compatibility or migration questions | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/breaking-changes.md |
| version-eol.md | EOL versions, support lifecycle, or version history | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/version-eol.md |
| os-support.md | OS packages, distro support, or glibc requirements | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/os-support.md |

### Broad Skills

| Skill | Fetch When | URL |
|-------|------------|-----|
| navigation.md | Multi-hop query and unsure which links to follow | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/navigation.md |
| schema.md | Need to understand document structure, properties, or link relations | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/schema.md |

## Quick Answers (1 fetch)

These are answered directly from `llms.json`:

- Latest patch for .NET X → `_embedded.latest_patches[]` filter by `release`
- Is .NET X supported? → `_embedded.latest_patches[]` → `supported`, `eol_date`
- CVE count in latest patch → `_embedded.latest_patches[]` → `cve_count`

## Navigation Shortcuts

Each `_embedded.latest_patches[]` entry has `_links` for 2-fetch navigation:

- `release-manifest` → manifest.json (breaking changes, TFMs, OS support)
- `release-major` → version index (patch navigation, timeline)
- `latest-sdk` → SDK index (feature bands, downloads)
- `latest-security` → last security patch for that version

## Key Relations

From `llms.json._links`:

| Relation | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `latest` | Newest supported release (LTS or STS) |
| `latest-lts` | Newest LTS release |
| `latest-security-month` | Current security month index |
| `releases-index` | Full version list including EOL |

**Relations that do NOT exist** (common mistakes):

| Relation | Why It Doesn't Exist |
|----------|---------------------|
| `next` | Navigate backwards from present — start at `latest*`, walk back with `prev` |
| `latest_sts` | Not useful — use `latest` if STS is acceptable |
