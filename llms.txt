# .NET Release Graph

Machine-readable .NET release, CVE, and compatibility data via HAL hypermedia.

## Graph Entry Point

Fetch: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/llms.json>

A HAL+JSON graph with temporal and version structure to enable diverse queries.

## Structured workflows

Fetch: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/release-index/release-notes/skills/dotnet-releases/workflows.json>

It contains links to:

- **workflows** — workflow queries that include HAL-native `follow_path`, `destination_kind`, `query_hints`
- **Skills** — References to behavior skills (CVE, breaking changes, etc.)

## Core Rules

1. **Follow `_links["..."].href` exactly** — never construct URLs
2. **Use `_embedded` data first** — answers most queries without extra fetches
3. **Don't fabricate** — report gaps
4. **Non-existent relations:** `next` (use `prev`), `latest_sts` (use `latest`)

## llms.json Contents

| Property | Contains |
| -------- | -------- |
| `supported_releases` | Supported .NET versions |
| `_embedded.patches` | Dictionary of supported versions keyed by major (e.g., `"8.0"`) |
| `_links` | Navigation to indexes, timeline, security months |

## Quick Answers (1 fetch)

From `llms.json._embedded.patches["X.0"]`:

- Latest patch for .NET X → access by version key
- Is .NET X supported? → `supported`, `eol_date`
- CVE count → `cve_count`

## Navigation Shortcuts

From `_embedded.patches["X.0"]._links`:

| Relation | Target |
| -------- | ------ |
| `manifest` | manifest.json (OS, breaking changes) |
| `latest-security-month` | Last security month |

From `llms.json._links`:

| Relation | Target |
| -------- | ------ |
| `latest`, `latest-lts` | Newest release (same when latest is LTS; diverge when STS is newer) |
| `latest-security-month` | Current security month |
| `root` | All versions including EOL |
