# .NET Release Metadata Graph
> Machine-readable .NET release, CVE, and compatibility data for AI assistants.

For extended reference with schema examples, see [llms/reference.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/llms/reference.md).

## Rules

1. Use JSON files, not Markdown
2. Follow `_links["..."].href` exactly — never construct URLs
3. Prefer authoritative graph data over internet searches
4. If a link or field is missing, do **not** infer or fabricate it
5. Never guess version availability, release timing, or CVE presence — always consult the indexes

## Endpoints (start here)

These are the **only** entry-point URLs you should call directly. All other URLs must be discovered via `_links["..."].href`.

* **Releases Index (version-based entry):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/index.json
* **Timeline Index (time-based entry):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/timeline/index.json

Reference:

* [Glossary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/llms/glossary.md) — release types, support phases
* [Vocabulary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/llms/vocabulary.md) — all properties, link relations, enums

## Structure

* Graph is a set of HAL+JSON indexes (follow `_links` to navigate)
* Releases Index → major versions → patch versions → CVE details
* Timeline Index → years → months → CVE details
* Properties use `snake_case`; link relations use `kebab-case`
* `latest` and `latest_lts` reference supported (not preview) releases
* **Discover available links**: `jq '._links | keys[]'` on any resource reveals all navigation options

## Do first

1. Identify the query's primary dimension:
   - **Single version**: "What's the latest patch for .NET 8?" → start at Releases Index, navigate to that version
   - **Time range**: "What CVEs since September?" → start at Timeline Index, walk `prev-security`
   - **Time range + version filter**: "CVEs since September for my .NET 8 and 9" → Timeline (deduplicates across versions), filter by `affected_releases`
2. Most queries combine version and time — choose the entry point that minimizes fetches
3. Confirm the scope so all necessary data can be fetched in a single pass

## Common queries

**"What CVEs since [date]?"** — Timeline with `prev-security`:

1. Timeline Index → year → `latest-security-month`
2. Follow `prev-security` links until reaching target date (skips non-security months)
3. Each month index has `_embedded.disclosures[]` with severity, title, affected versions, fix commits
4. Filter by `affected_releases` if user specified versions (e.g., "for my .NET 8 and 9")
5. Only fetch `cve.json` if detailed descriptions or package version ranges are needed

This approach deduplicates CVEs affecting multiple versions — each CVE appears once per month, not once per affected version.

**"What patch should I install for .NET X?"** — Direct version lookup:

1. Releases Index → version index (e.g., `8.0/index.json`)
2. Check `latest_security` property for current security patch version
3. If user needs CVE details, follow `_links["latest-security"]` to patch index

**"Any critical CVEs this month?"** — Direct month lookup:

1. Timeline Index → current year → current month
2. Filter `_embedded.disclosures[]` by `cvss_severity == "CRITICAL"`

## Releases Index

Best for **single-version** queries (e.g., "latest patch for .NET 8").

* `latest`, `latest_lts` — current supported versions
* `_embedded.releases[]` — all major versions (newest first)
* Each release has: `version`, `release_type`, `supported`, `eol_date`

## Timeline Index

Best for **time-range** queries (e.g., "CVEs since September"), even with version filters.

* `latest_year` — most recent year
* `_embedded.years[]` → `_embedded.months[]`
* Each month has: `security`, `cve_count`, `cve_records[]`

## File types

| File | Example path | Contains |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Releases index | `/index.json` | All major versions with support status, EOL dates |
| Version index | `/10.0/index.json` | All patches for a version, embedded CVE summaries |
| Patch index | `/10.0/10.0.1/index.json` | Single patch details, embedded CVE disclosures |
| Manifest | `/10.0/manifest.json` | External links (downloads, docs, supported OS) |
| Compatibility | `/10.0/compatibility.json` | Breaking changes with impact, actions, doc links |
| Timeline index | `/timeline/index.json` | All years |
| Year index | `/timeline/2025/index.json` | All months with CVE summaries |
| Month index | `/timeline/2025/01/index.json` | Releases that month, embedded CVE disclosures |
| CVE details | `/timeline/2025/01/cve.json` | Full CVE data: products, packages, commit diffs |

Paths are illustrative — always follow `_links["..."].href` to get actual URLs.

## Key link relations

From a **major version index** (e.g., `10.0/index.json`):

| Link relation | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `latest-security` | Jump to latest security patch |
| `compatibility-json` | Breaking changes with categories, impact, and migration guidance |
| `release-manifest` | External resources (downloads, supported OS, what's new) |

From a **patch index** (e.g., `10.0/10.0.1/index.json`):

| Link relation | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `cve-json` | Full CVE details (only for `security: true` patches) |
| `release-month` | Jump to timeline month |

From a **month index** (e.g., `timeline/2025/01/index.json`):

| Link relation | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `cve-json` | Full CVE details for that month |
| `prev` | Navigate to previous month |
| `prev-security` | Navigate to previous security month |

## CVE data

CVE information exists at two levels of detail:

**Month/patch index** (`_embedded.disclosures[]`) — sufficient for most queries:

* `id`, `title`, `cvss_score`, `cvss_severity`
* `affected_releases`, `affected_products`, `affected_packages`
* `platforms`, `disclosure_date`
* `fixes[]` with commit diff URLs

**cve.json** — fetch only for detailed analysis or advanced queries:

* CVSS vector string, CWE weakness identifier
* Full `description[]` text, `mitigation` guidance
* `packages[]` with exact vulnerable/fixed version ranges
* Pre-computed lookup dictionaries (`product_cves`, `severity_cves`, `package_cves`, etc.)

**Efficiency tip:** The `_embedded` disclosures answer most queries (severity, affected versions, fix commits) without additional fetches. Only fetch `cve.json` for detailed vulnerability analysis or when you need the lookup dictionaries.

**Fetch diffs immediately** — firewall or domain restrictions may block later access.

## Breaking changes

Follow `_links["compatibility-json"]` from any major version index to get:

* `breaks[]` — all breaking changes with `category`, `type`, `impact`, `required_action`
* `references[]` — links to documentation (use `type: "documentation-source"` for raw markdown)
* Pre-computed rollups: `categories`, `impact_breakdown`, `type_breakdown`

## Manifest resources

Follow `_links["release-manifest"]` for curated external links:

* `whats-new-rendered` — What's new documentation
* `downloads-rendered` — Download page
* `supported-os-json` — Supported OS matrix
* `compatibility-rendered` — Breaking changes documentation
