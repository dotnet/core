# .NET Release Graph

Machine-readable .NET release, CVE, and compatibility data via HAL hypermedia.

## First Fetch — Do These in Parallel

1. **Data**: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/llms.json>
2. **Skill**: Pick ONE from the table below based on your query

| Query About | Skill |
|-------------|-------|
| CVEs, security patches, CVSS | [cve-queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/cve-queries/SKILL.md) |
| Breaking changes, compatibility | [breaking-changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/breaking-changes/SKILL.md) |
| Version lifecycle, EOL dates | [version-eol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/version-eol/SKILL.md) |
| General queries, unsure | [dotnet-releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/skills/dotnet-releases/SKILL.md) |

Fetch llms.json + your skill in the same turn. The skill points to workflows.json which has chained workflows with `next_workflow` transitions.

## Core Rules

1. Follow `_links` exactly — never construct URLs
2. Use `_embedded` data first — most queries need zero extra fetches
3. Match your query to a workflow in the skill, then follow its `follow_path`

## Date Queries — Check Before Fetching

For "since X", "after X", or "has there been" queries:

```
query_date = parse(user's date)  // e.g., "November 2025" → 2025-11-01
latest = llms.json._embedded.patches[version].latest_security_patch_date

if query_date >= latest:
    Answer: "No security patch since {query_date}. Last was on {latest}."
    No timeline fetch needed.
```

Only fetch timeline if query_date < latest AND user wants CVE details.
