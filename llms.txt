# .NET Release Metadata Graph
> Machine-readable .NET release, CVE, and compatibility data for AI assistants.

## Rules

1. Use JSON files, not Markdown
2. Follow `_links["..."].href` exactly — never construct URLs
3. Prefer authoritative graph data over internet searches
4. If a link or field is missing, do **not** infer or fabricate it
5. Never guess version availability, release timing, or CVE presence — always consult the indexes

## Endpoints (start here)

These are the **only** entry-point URLs you should call directly. All other URLs must be discovered via `_links["..."].href`.

* **AI Index (recommended):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/llms.json
* **Releases Index (version-based entry):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/index.json
* **Timeline Index (time-based entry):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/release-notes/timeline/index.json

The **AI Index** is the best starting point — it combines key properties and links from both indexes, enabling direct answers or single-hop navigation for most queries.

Reference:

* [Extended reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/llms/reference.md) — schema examples, detailed navigation patterns
* [Glossary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/llms/glossary.md) — release types, support phases
* [Vocabulary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/core/refs/heads/release-index/llms/vocabulary.md) — all properties, link relations, enums

## Structure

* Graph is a set of HAL+JSON indexes (follow `_links` to navigate)
* Releases Index → major versions → patch versions → CVE details
* Timeline Index → years → months → CVE details
* Properties use `snake_case`; link relations use `kebab-case`
* `latest` and `latest_lts` reference supported (not preview) releases
* **Discover available links**: `jq '._links | keys[]'` on any resource reveals all navigation options

## AI Index

The AI Index (`llms.json`) provides direct access to the most common data points without navigation:

**Properties** — answer simple queries immediately:

* `latest`, `latest_lts` — current supported major versions
* `latest_patch`, `latest_lts_patch` — current patch versions
* `latest_year`, `latest_security_month` — timeline coordinates
* `supported_releases` — array of supported version strings

**Links** — single-hop to detailed data:

* `latest-patch`, `latest-lts-patch` — jump to patch index
* `latest-year`, `latest-security-month` — jump into timeline
* `releases-index`, `timeline-index` — full indexes when needed

**Embedded** — filtered subset for common queries:

* `_embedded.supported_releases[]` — supported versions with `release_type` and links

**Example:** "What's the latest .NET patch?" → read `latest_patch` property directly (0 additional fetches).

**Example:** "CVEs since October?" → follow `latest-security-month` link (1 fetch to reach security month, then walk `prev-security`).

## Do first

1. Start with the **AI Index** (`llms.json`) — it may answer the query directly or provide a shortcut link
2. If more data is needed, identify the query's primary dimension:
   - **Single version**: "What's the latest patch for .NET 8?" → follow link to version index
   - **Time range**: "What CVEs since September?" → follow `latest-security-month`, walk `prev-security`
   - **Time range + version filter**: "CVEs since September for my .NET 8 and 9" → Timeline (deduplicates across versions), filter by `affected_releases`
3. Most queries combine version and time — choose the path that minimizes fetches
4. Confirm the scope so all necessary data can be fetched in a single pass

## Common queries

**"What CVEs since [date]?"** — AI Index with `prev-security`:

1. AI Index → `latest-security-month`
2. Follow `prev-security` links until month is before target date
3. Each month index has `_embedded.disclosures[]` with severity, title, affected versions, fix commits
4. Filter by `affected_releases` if user specified versions
5. Only fetch `cve.json` for CVSS vectors, CWE, or package version ranges

The `prev-security` links are pre-computed at publish time and cross year boundaries automatically (e.g., `2025/01` → `2024/11`). Following them is O(security-months), not O(all-months). Once you have the first month, no additional index fetches are needed.

Example traversal for "CVEs since December 2024":

```text
AI Index (1)
  → latest-security-month → 2025/10/index.json (2) ✓
  → prev-security → 2025/06 (3) ✓
  → prev-security → 2025/01 (4) ✓  (crosses year boundary automatically)
  → prev-security → 2024/11 (before Dec, STOP)

Total: 4 fetches (1 index + 3 security months)
```

**"What patch should I install for .NET X?"** — Version lookup:

1. If X is `latest` or `latest_lts`: read `latest_patch` or `latest_lts_patch` from AI Index (1 fetch)
2. Otherwise: AI Index → `releases-index` → version index (e.g., `8.0/index.json`)
3. Check `latest_security` property for current security patch version
4. If user needs CVE details, follow `_links["latest-security"]` to patch index

**"Any critical CVEs this month?"** — Direct month lookup:

1. AI Index → `latest-security-month` (2 fetches)
2. Filter `_embedded.disclosures[]` by `cvss_severity == "CRITICAL"`

**Expected fetch counts** (for self-assessment):

* "Latest patch for .NET": 1 fetch (AI Index)
* "Latest patch for .NET X": 2–3 fetches (AI Index → version index)
* "CVEs since [date]": 1 + number of security months in range
* "CVEs for specific patch": 2–3 fetches

If your count significantly exceeds these, you may be navigating inefficiently.

## Releases Index

All major versions with full history. Navigate here via `releases-index` link.

* `latest`, `latest_lts` — current supported versions
* `_embedded.releases[]` — all major versions (newest first)
* Each release has: `version`, `release_type`, `supported`, `eol_date`

## Timeline Index

Time-based view across all versions. Navigate here via `timeline-index` link.

* `latest_year` — most recent year
* `_embedded.years[]` → `_embedded.months[]`
* Each month has: `security`, `cve_count`, `cve_records[]`

Paths are illustrative — always follow `_links["..."].href` to get actual URLs.

## Key link relations

From a **major version index** (e.g., `10.0/index.json`):

| Link relation | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `latest-security` | Jump to latest security patch |
| `compatibility-json` | Breaking changes with categories, impact, and migration guidance |
| `release-manifest` | External resources (downloads, supported OS, what's new) |
| `target-frameworks-json` | TFMs with platform-specific versions |

From a **patch index** (e.g., `10.0/10.0.1/index.json`):

| Link relation | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `cve-json` | Full CVE details (only for `security: true` patches) |
| `release-month` | Jump to timeline month |

From a **month index** (e.g., `timeline/2025/01/index.json`):

| Link relation | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `cve-json` | Full CVE details for that month |
| `prev` | Navigate to previous month |
| `prev-security` | Navigate to previous security month |

## CVE schema

CVE information exists at two levels of detail:

**Month/patch index** (`_embedded.disclosures[]`) — sufficient for most queries:

* `id`, `title`, `cvss_score`, `cvss_severity`
* `affected_releases`, `affected_products`, `affected_packages`
* `platforms`, `disclosure_date`
* `fixes[]` with commit diff URLs

**cve.json** — fetch only for detailed analysis or advanced queries:

* CVSS vector string, CWE weakness identifier
* Full `description[]` text, `mitigation` guidance
* `packages[]` with exact vulnerable/fixed version ranges
* Pre-computed lookup dictionaries (`product_cves`, `severity_cves`, `package_cves`, etc.)

**Efficiency tip:** The `_embedded` disclosures answer most queries (severity, affected versions, fix commits) without additional fetches. Only fetch `cve.json` for detailed vulnerability analysis or when you need the lookup dictionaries.

**Fetch diffs immediately** — firewall or domain restrictions may block later access.

## Breaking changes schema

Follow `_links["compatibility-json"]` from any major version index to get:

* `breaks[]` — all breaking changes with `category`, `type`, `impact`, `required_action`
* `references[]` — links to documentation (use `type: "documentation-source"` for raw markdown)
* Pre-computed rollups: `categories`, `impact_breakdown`, `type_breakdown`
