# MICROSOFT PRE-DISCLOSURE COMMON VULNERABILITIES AND EXPOSURES COLLABORATION AGREEMENT

Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) is pleased to work with Company Ltd. (“Collaborator”) on an information sharing engagement. This letter (“Agreement”) outlines the terms and conditions of this limited engagement. Microsoft and Collaborator agree to work  together in good faith as described herein for the benefit of the .NET ecosystem. Confidential information disclosed or exchanged  pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the Microsoft Corporation Non-Disclosure Agreement between Microsoft and Collaborator, dated [NDA date] (“NDA”).

1. **Disclosure of Information**. Microsoft is collaborating with Collaborator and certain other third parties who are users of .NET to  share in confidence early information concerning possible security vulnerabilities in advance of their publication by Microsoft (“Pre Disclosure CVEs”). Collaborator will share with Microsoft information it discovers or learns of on possible .NET security vulnerabilities, which  Microsoft may in its discretion publish as CVEs. Each party will bear its own expenses in relation to the Project and no fees or payments are contemplated by either party to the other.

2. **Coordination**. Microsoft will share confidential Pre-Disclosure CVEs (description and fixes) with Collaborator from time to time, generally on a schedule pre-determined by Microsoft. Collaborator will make commercially reasonable efforts to apply sufficient resources to release updates (to  Collaborator assets) in a reasonably timely manner after a release embargo is lifted by Microsoft. Release embargoes are lifted after published disclosure by Microsoft, at dotnet/announcements (GitHub), the .NET Blog (devblogs.microsoft.com), or as communicated by Microsoft in writing. The  parties may agree during the Term to a specific release schedule for updates. The parties acknowledge that potential vulnerabilities,  which may be similar to or the same as a Pre-Disclosure CVE, may be discovered or learned of by third parties independent of this  Agreement, but the parties will nonetheless coordinate and observe release embargoes with respect to Pre-Disclosure CVEs.

3. **Collaboration with Other Parties**. Microsoft intends to engage with a group of interested and known industry parties (who have  also entered into an agreement substantially the same as this Agreement) in a similar way as Microsoft and Collaborator are  collaborating under this Agreement. Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to collaborate in good faith with all other such parties to the program. Within the group, parties may share information relating to their respective products, builds, schedules, processes, dependencies, etc.  Collaborator agrees to keep confidential all information received from other parties while participating in the group.

4. **Proprietary Rights**. With the exception of information shared under Section 1, neither party grants the other (by implication, estoppel or otherwise) any right, title, interest, or license, in any patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyrights, mask work rights, trademarks or other intellectual property. Collaborator grants Microsoft a license to use, publish, and commercialize information shared under Section 1. 

5. **Data**. Collaborator and Microsoft will not provide each other with any customer data, personal data, or personally identifiable  information in connection with this Agreement.

6. **Confidentiality and Publicity**. Without limiting the parties’ obligations under the NDA with respect to Pre-Disclosure CVEs and any  other confidential information or materials exchanged between the parties in connection with this Agreement, Microsoft is free to  publish CVEs when and in such form it determines in its discretion, after which time such published information shall no longer be  considered confidential information. Collaborator agrees to be named as a member of Microsoft’s .NET pre-disclosure group along  with other participants and to collaborate in good faith in group communications and agreed publications.

7. **Termination**. This Agreement is effective as of the date on which it has been signed by Collaborator as shown in the signature block  below (“Effective Date”) and will remain in effect for a term of one year following the Effective Date (“Term”), after which the  Agreement will automatically renew for additional one year renewal terms. Either party may terminate this Agreement effective immediately at any time  by providing written notice to the other, provided that Collaborator will continue to make commercially reasonable efforts to apply sufficient resources to release updates (to  Collaborator assets) in a reasonably timely manner for Pre-Disclosure CVEs shared during the Term. Upon request, each party will return to the other party or destroy any Confidential Information received from the other party in connection with this Agreement. Provisions pertaining to confidentiality,  limitation of liability, and choice of law provisions will survive any such termination of this Agreement.

8. **Warranties**. Neither party makes any warranties. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each party, and its respective  affiliates, agents, and representatives expressly disclaim all express, statutory, and implied warranties. Microsoft’s Pre-Disclosure  CVEs and related information may be incomplete, may contain bugs or errors and may not become published as CVEs. Collaborator agrees that it is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of utilizing the Pre-Disclosure CVEs.

9. **Limitation of liability**. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES LIMIT THEIR LIABILITY FOR ANY  CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO $500 USD AND IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY (INCLUDING THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS  AND AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES  ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. THESE EXCLUSIONS APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER APPLICATION OF THESE EXCLUSIONS  CAUSES ANY REMEDY TO FAIL OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THIS SECTION 9 WILL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF EITHER  PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR (i) VIOLATION OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR (ii) WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

10. **Governing Law**. The terms of this Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of  New York of the United States of America, U.S.A. 

11. **Entire agreement; assignment**. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties regarding its limited subject matter  and merges and replaces all prior and contemporaneous agreements, communications, and representations between the parties  regarding its subject matter. Collaborator may not assign or transfer this Agreement to a third party without Microsoft’s prior  written consent.

Sincerely,

Microsoft Corporation
