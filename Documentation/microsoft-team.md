# Microsoft Team Onboarding

If you are new to Microsoft or working with the .NET Team, you will need to onboard into various GitHub projects in order to get your work done.

## Join .NET teams in dotnet and Microsoft orgs

You need to link your GitHub and @microsoft.com accounts. Click the link:

* [Link your GitHub account](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/link)

You need to join teams in two organizations. Click the two links:

* [dotnet org](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/dotnet/teams/microsoft/join/)
* [Microsoft org](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/teams/dotnet/join/)

After you join the teams: 

* Users will be able to @mention you on [.NET Core Repos](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/core-repos.md)
* You will be able to access to private repos we maintain
* You will get write access to a subset of repos

## Configure your GitHub account as a Microsoft employee (recommended)

* Publicly associate yourself with dotnet and Microsoft orgs
    * For Microsoft, go to https://github.com/orgs/Microsoft/people
    * For dotnet, go to https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/people
    * Search for your GitHub handle in the list
    * Choose `Public` from the drop-down list of organization visibility
    * Note: Everyone will now see an org badge on your GH profile in the Organizations section
* Update your profile
    * Go to https://github.com/settings/profile
    * Match your **Name** on GitHub with full name in address book (so other employees can find you and contact you internally when needed)
    * Set `@Microsoft` as your **Company**
    * Upload your **picture**, ideally showing your face
        * Hint: You can grab your GAL picture from https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com

## Install Microsoft open source tools (recommended)

The tools make it easier to use open source and participate in open source projects:

* [Browser Extension](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/browser.html) -- Identifies Microsoft employees on GitHub.
* [VS Code Extension](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/vscode.html) --  Provides information about known vulnerabilities.

The browser extension is recommended. The VS code extension is optional.

## Get write permissions to repos (optional)

Join teams to gain write access to repos:
 * Request team membership via https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/teams
 * Find the right teams - e.g. `dotnet-coreclr`, `dotnet-corefx`, etc.
 * Ask someone if you don't know which team to join.
 * Select `Request to join this team` on the right side - it will send email request to maintainers of the team

## Service Accounts

Service accounts should also be linked. For more details, see [Service accounts for GitHub](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/github/service-accounts.html).
