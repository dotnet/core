# Official Microsoft Docs

Microsoft maintains official documentation for .NET, listed below. Both .NET and .NET Framework docs are relevant to .NET developers, both because many .NET Framework APIs are part of .NET (most relevant for .NET Core 2.0) but also because you can reference .NET Framework libraries with .NET Standard 2.0.

## .NET Framework
