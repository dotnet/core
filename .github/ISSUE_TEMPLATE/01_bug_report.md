### Description

<!--
* Please share a clear and concise description of the problem.
* Include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. E.g.: the smallest possible code snippet; or a small repo to clone, with steps to run it.
* What behavior are you seeing, and what behavior would you expect?
  -->

### Configuration

<!--
* Which version of .NET is the code running on?
* What OS and version, and for Linux, what distro?
* What is the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64)?
* Do you know whether it is specific to that configuration?
* If you're using Blazor, which web browser(s) do you see this issue in?
  -->

### Regression?

<!--
* Did this work in a previous build or release of .NET Core, or from .NET Framework? If you can try a previous release or build to find out, that can help us narrow down the problem. If you don't know, that's OK.
