## What is this?

This package exposes constants used throughout the micromark ecosystem.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
It’s useful to reference these constants by name instead of value while
developing.
[`micromark-build`][micromark-build] compiles them away for production code.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-symbol
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import * as symbol from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as symbol from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {codes, constants, types, values} from 'micromark-util-symbol'

console.log(codes.atSign) // 64
console.log(constants.characterReferenceNamedSizeMax) // 31
console.log(types.definitionDestinationRaw) // 'definitionDestinationRaw'
console.log(values.atSign) // '@'
```

## API

This package exports the identifiers `codes`, `constants`, `types`, and
`values`.
There is no default export.

Each identifier is an object mapping strings to values.
See the code for the exposed data.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`micromark-util-symbol@2`, compatible with Node.js 16.
This package works with `micromark@3`.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.
