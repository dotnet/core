# markdownlint-rule-helpers

> A collection of `markdownlint` helper functions for custom rules

## Overview

The [Markdown][markdown] linter [`markdownlint`][markdownlint] offers a variety
of built-in validation [rules][rules] and supports the creation of [custom
rules][custom-rules]. The internal rules share various helper functions; this
package exposes those for reuse by custom rules.

## API

*Undocumented* - This package exports the internal functions as-is. The APIs
were not originally meant to be public, are not officially supported, and may
change from release to release. There are brief descriptive comments above each
function, but no [JSDoc][jsdoc] annotations. That said, some of what's here will
be useful to custom rule authors and may avoid duplicating code.

## Tests

*None* - The entire body of code is tested to 100% coverage by the core
`markdownlint` project, so there are no additional tests here.
