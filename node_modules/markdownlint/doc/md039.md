# `MD039` - Spaces inside link text

Tags: `links`, `whitespace`

Aliases: `no-space-in-links`

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered on links that have spaces surrounding the link text:

```markdown
[ a link ](https://www.example.com/)
```

To fix this, remove the spaces surrounding the link text:

```markdown
[a link](https://www.example.com/)
```

Rationale: Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.
