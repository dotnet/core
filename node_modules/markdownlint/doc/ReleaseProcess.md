# Release Process

The `markdownlint` library has some related dependencies that are updated along
with it. To prevent possible regressions from having a widespread impact, these
releases are separated by a few days to provide an opportunity to find issues.

1. [`markdownlint`][markdownlint]
2. [`markdownlint-cli2`][markdownlint-cli2]
3. [`markdownlint-cli2-action`][markdownlint-cli2-action]
4. [`vscode-markdownlint`][vscode-markdownlint]
5. [`markdownlint-cli`][markdownlint-cli]

This sequence is not strict and may be adjusted based on the content of the
release and the scope of feature work in each dependency.
