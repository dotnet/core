# `MD055` - Table pipe style

Tags: `table`

Aliases: `table-pipe-style`

Parameters:

- `style`: Table pipe style (`string`, default `consistent`, values
  `consistent` / `leading_and_trailing` / `leading_only` /
  `no_leading_or_trailing` / `trailing_only`)

This rule is triggered when a [GitHub Flavored Markdown table][gfm-table-055]
is inconsistent about its use of leading and trailing pipe characters (`|`).

By default (`consistent` style), the header row of the first table in a document
is used to determine the style that is enforced for every table in the document.
A specific style can be used instead (`leading_and_trailing`, `leading_only`,
`no_leading_or_trailing`, `trailing_only`).

This table's header row has leading and trailing pipes, but its delimiter row is
missing the trailing pipe and its first row of cells is missing the leading
pipe:

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------
  Cell   | Cell   |
```

To fix these issues, make sure there is a pipe character at the beginning and
end of every row:

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |
```

Note that text immediately following a table (i.e., not separated by an empty
line) is treated as part of the table (per the specification) and may also
trigger this rule:

```markdown
| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |
This text is part of the table
```

Rationale: Some parsers have difficulty with tables that are missing their
leading or trailing pipe characters. The use of leading/trailing pipes can also
help provide visual clarity.
