# `MD051` - Link fragments should be valid

Tags: `links`

Aliases: `link-fragments`

Parameters:

- `ignore_case`: Ignore case of fragments (`boolean`, default `false`)
- `ignored_pattern`: Pattern for ignoring additional fragments (`string`,
  default ``)

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered when a link fragment does not match any of the fragments
that are automatically generated for headings in a document:

```markdown
# Heading Name

[Link](#fragment)
```

To fix this issue, change the link fragment to reference an existing heading's
generated name (see below):

```markdown
# Heading Name

[Link](#heading-name)
```

For consistency, this rule requires fragments to exactly match the [GitHub
heading algorithm][github-heading-algorithm] which converts letters to
lowercase. Therefore, the following example is reported as a violation:

```markdown
# Heading Name

[Link](#Heading-Name)
```

To ignore case when comparing fragments with heading names, the `ignore_case`
parameter can be set to `true`. In this configuration, the previous example is
not reported as a violation.

Alternatively, some platforms allow the syntax `{#named-anchor}` to be used
within a heading to provide a specific name (consisting of only lower-case
letters, numbers, `-`, and `_`):

```markdown
# Heading Name {#custom-name}

[Link](#custom-name)
```

Alternatively, any HTML tag with an `id` attribute or an `a` tag with a `name`
attribute can be used to define a fragment:

```markdown
<a id="bookmark"></a>

[Link](#bookmark)
```

An `a` tag can be useful in scenarios where a heading is not appropriate or for
control over the text of the fragment identifier.

[HTML links to `#top` scroll to the top of a document][html-top-fragment]. This
rule allows that syntax (using lower-case for consistency):

```markdown
[Link](#top)
```

This rule also recognizes the custom fragment syntax used by GitHub to highlight
[specific content in a document][github-linking-to-content].

For example, this link to line 20:

```markdown
[Link](#L20)
```

And this link to content starting within line 19 running into line 21:

```markdown
[Link](#L19C5-L21C11)
```

Some Markdown generators dynamically create and insert headings when building
documents, for example by combining a fixed prefix like `figure-` and an
incrementing numeric counter. To ignore such generated fragments, set the
`ignored_pattern` [regular expression][RegEx] parameter to a pattern that
matches (e.g., `^figure-`).

Rationale: [GitHub section links][github-section-links] are created
automatically for every heading when Markdown content is displayed on GitHub.
This makes it easy to link directly to different sections within a document.
However, section links change if headings are renamed or removed. This rule
helps identify broken section links within a document.

Section links are **not** part of the CommonMark specification. This rule
enforces the [GitHub heading algorithm][github-heading-algorithm] which is:
convert heading to lowercase, remove punctuation, convert spaces to dashes,
append an incrementing integer as needed for uniqueness.
