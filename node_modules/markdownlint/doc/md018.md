# `MD018` - No space after hash on atx style heading

Tags: `atx`, `headings`, `spaces`

Aliases: `no-missing-space-atx`

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered when spaces are missing after the hash characters
in an atx style heading:

```markdown
#Heading 1

##Heading 2
```

To fix this, separate the heading text from the hash character by a single
space:

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2
```

Rationale: Violations of this rule can lead to improperly rendered content.
