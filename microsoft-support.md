# Microsoft support for .NET

[Microsoft supports .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) on multiple operating systems, per the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy).

Support is provided for: .NET SDK, .NET runtime, ASP.NET Core, and EF Core.

Support has two key benefits:

* Patches are provided (for free) as required for functional or security issues, typically monthly.
* You can [contact Microsoft support to request help](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/onboarding) (potentially at a cost).

You can also request community support on GitHub (for free), but there is no guarantee on a quick reply.

Support is conditional on using the latest .NET patch update and a supported operating system, as defined by:

* [Microsoft support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy)
* [.NET releases](releases.md)
* [.NET release policies](release-policies.md)
* [.NET supported operating system lifecycle](os-lifecycle-policy.md).

Knowing key dates for a product lifecycle helps you make informed decisions about when to upgrade or make other changes to your software and computing environment.
