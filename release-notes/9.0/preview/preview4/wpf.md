## Support for Windows 11 theming 

For consumer applications built on WPF and running on Windows 11, this feature enables them to leverage modern design elements and behaviors. This includes features such as: 

- Light and dark theme support 
- Rounded corners for controls, and 
- Windows 11 design styles for controls

This can be enabled by adding the following to your `App.xaml`

```xml
<Application.Resources>
    <ResourceDictionary>
        <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
            <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/PresentationFramework.Fluent;component/Themes/Fluent.xaml" />
        </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
    </ResourceDictionary>
</Application.Resources>
```

## Hyphen based ligature support 

Based on the WPF community feedback, we have now fixed the issue with Hyphen based ligatures not working in WPF. Summary: A call to LsTxtFmt (Text Formatter) is made when a line is being created. Previously, in LsTxtFmt, glyphing was only performed for regular characters. However, after the fix, glyphing will also be performed for special characters, such as hyphens.
