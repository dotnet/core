# .NET 9 Preview 1 - February 13, 2024

Welcome to .NET 9! We're happy to deliver the first preview of .NET 9 and share in-depth release notes that provide varied and impressive improvements for the first preview out of the gate. We also published [Our Vision for .NET 9](https://aka.ms/dotnet/9/vision), which describes some of the broad areas we intend to deliver on by the final November 2024 release.

The latest .NET 9 release is always available at [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) and [.NET 9 Releases](../README.md). Instructions on getting started .NET 9 can be found on the [get started guide](../../get-started.md).
