## Azure AppServices

Deployment of .NET Core 2.0 support on Azure AppServices is in process. Because AppServices is a high availability service, the deployment is carfully staged across regions over a period of time. Deployment will begin in the West US 2 and North Central US regions with remaining regions following over few days.
