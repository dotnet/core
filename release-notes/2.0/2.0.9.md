## Blog Round up

* [.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-july-2018-update/)

The .NET Core SDK 2.1 includes .NET Core 2.1 Runtime so downloading the runtime packages separately is not needed when installing the SDK. After installing the .NET Core SDK 2.1, running `dotnet --version` will show that you're running version `2.1.202` of the .NET Core tools.

`dotnet --info` has been greatly enhanced in .NET Core 2.1 and now provides detailed information on installed .NET Core components.

Your feedback is important and appreciated. We've created an issue at [dotnet/core #/1766](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues//1766) for your questions and comments.

## Azure AppServices

* Deployment of .NET Core 2.0.9 to Azure App Services has begun. It will be available in limited regions today and expected worldwide by the end of the week.

## .NET Core Lifecycle News

See [.NET Core Supported OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md) to learn about Windows, macOS and Linux versions that are supported for each .NET Core release.

.NET Core 2.1 is expected to be declared LTS in the next few months. It is recommended that 2.1 be the default target for projects. .NET Core 2.0 will go out of support October 2018.

### Supported Linux version changes

Fedora 26 and Ubuntu 17.10 will reach end of life in July. This is the last update of .NET Core which will support these versions.

### Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-8356: .NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability

[CVE-2018-8356: .NET Core Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/73)

Executive summary

Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET Core. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.

Microsoft is aware of a security feature bypass vulnerability that exists when .NET Core does not correctly validate certificates. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could present an expired certificate when challenged.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core applications handle certificate validation.
