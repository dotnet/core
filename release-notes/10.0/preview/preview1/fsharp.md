# F# 10 updates in .NET 10 Preview 1 - Release Notes

Release notes for F# are generated for all contributions to the [dotnet/fsharp](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp) repository and split across language, library and compiler changes.


## F# Language

[Release notes for new F# language features](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/release-notes/Language.html) list language changes that have to be enabled by `<LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>` project property in `.fsproj` project file. They will become the default with .NET 10 release.


## FSharp.Core

[Changes to the FSharp.Core standard library](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/release-notes/FSharp.Core.html) are applied automatically to projects compiled with new SDK, unless they pin down a lower FSharp.Core version.


## FSharp.Compiler.Service
