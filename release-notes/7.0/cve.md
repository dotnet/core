# .NET 7 CVEs

The .NET Team releases [monthly updates for .NET 7](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/.NET%207.0) on [Patch Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday). These updates often include security fixes. If you are on an older version, your app may be vulnerable.

Your app needs to be on the latest .NET 7 patch version to be secure. The longer you wait to upgrade, the greater the exposure to CVEs.

## Which CVEs apply to my app?

Your app may be vulnerable to the following published security [CVEs](https://www.cve.org/) if you are using the given version or older.
