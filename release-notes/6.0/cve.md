# .NET 6 CVEs

The .NET Team releases [monthly updates for .NET 6](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/.NET%206.0) on [Patch Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday). These updates often include security fixes. If you are on an older version, your app may be vulnerable.

Your app needs to be on the latest .NET 6 patch version to be secure. The longer you wait to upgrade, the greater the exposure to CVEs.

## Which CVEs apply to my app?

Your app may be vulnerable to the following published security [CVEs](https://www.cve.org/) if you are using the given version or older.

The CVEs are displayed one month offset from when they were released. For example, the CVE listed with `6.0.0` was disclosed and a fix was published with `6.0.1`. `6.0.1` is not vulnerable to that CVE while `6.0.0` is. As a result, the CVE is listed with `6.0.0`, where it still applies. The same model is used for the other releases.

The CVE exposure is cumulative. For example, `6.0.0` users may be vulnerable to the CVEs present in `6.0.0` and newer releases. Similarly, `6.0.3` users may be vulnerable to the CVEs present in `6.0.4` and newer releases. The latest release is not vulnerable to any published CVEs.
