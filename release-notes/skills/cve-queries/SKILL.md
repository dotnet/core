# CVE Queries

All CVE queries use timeline. Fetch workflows.json for navigation paths with `next_workflow` transitions.

## Stop Criteria

| Need | Stop At | Has |
|------|---------|-----|
| Severity, CVSS, affected versions | month index | `_embedded.disclosures[]` |
| Code diffs, CWE, version ranges | cve.json | different schema—see `next_workflow` |

## Rules

1. Follow `_links` only. Never construct URLs.
2. Year indexes must be fetched sequentially via `prev-year`.
3. Code diffs: `$.commits[key].url` already ends in `.diff` — use as-is. Never fetch commit HTML pages.
