* [`[3568476cca]`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/commit/3568476cca) aspnet-webpack auto-loads 'event-source-polyfill' on client when HMR is enabled. This requires 'event-source-polyfill' to be included in the client-side bundle, so it's also now added to all the templates' vendor bundles. Fixes #365.
* [`[93779a5e46]`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/commit/93779a5e46) aspnet-webpack configures HMR to point directly to http://localhost:<port>/__webpack_hmr instead of proxying via /__webpack_hmr. This is because IE/Edge doesn't honour CORS headers properly following redirects (returns "Network Error 0x80004004").

* [`[d0927bdc75]`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/commit/d0927bdc75) Fixes #2464 - Does not add extra skipped entries for model bound from services. Also ensures that when a type is marked as skipped, any sub property which is model bound (and hence a modelstate un validated entry), is marked as skipped (otherwise it would cause the ModelState to be invalid).

* [`[1570e198ef]`](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/commit/1570e198ef) Bug #1354 - ViewComponent View() fails on CoreCLR with IEnumerable<> passed in. Fix - When the model is passed in to a View, ViewDataDictionary sets it. During this process, we recurse through all the properties and create FastPropertyGetters for each of them. In this case, since it is an enumerable, the properties which we recurse through are not the elements of the collection but the properties of the Enumerable instead. i.e - Enumerable.Current. Creating getters for these properties are not necessary. The fix moves the property iteration step to a place where the properties are actually requested. - Splitting TypeInformation class into two and separating their caches appropriately.
