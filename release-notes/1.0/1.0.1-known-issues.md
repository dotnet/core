## macOS Sierra

`dotnet` command not found after installing on a clean macOS Sierra system that previously did not have .NET Core SDK installed.


`ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin` will create the symbolic link in the correct location and `dotnet` should now work.

## .NET Core 1.0.1 - VS 2015 Tooling Preview 2 installer fails

There was a recent change in the VC Redist installer which may lead to a failure during installation of .NET Core 1.0.1 - VS 2015 Tooling Preview 2. The workaround is to install the VC Redist before installing .NET Core 1.0.1 - VS 2015 Tooling Preview 2.

First, install appropriate VC_Redist:
