### dotnet new

A great deal of work has gone into `dotnet new` since our last update continuing to improve this important tool. An important thing to know is the default behavior of `dotnet new` no longer defaults to a creating a console template. Details and a walk through can be seen in the [.NET Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-tools-updates-in-vs-2017-rc/).

### Changes to Docker

Important changes have been made to our tags for this release in the [dotnet repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/). The `latest` and `nanoserver` tags now utilize the msbuild SDK and are not compatible with project.json projects. Additional details can be seen in the [.NET Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-tools-updates-in-vs-2017-rc/).

### Changes to Supported Linux Distros

[Fedora 23](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/OHFCBTYXAO6NBH5BZZI3VIMIIL2ODFP5/) and [openSUSE 13.2](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2017-01/msg00033.html) recently went out of support, per their respective project lifecycle. As a result, we are now no longer supporting or building for Fedora 23 and openSUSE 13.2.

We will be publishing a more formal policy on Linux distro support, in particular on managing end-of-life of distros. There will be opportunity for feedback on the policy before it is finalized.
